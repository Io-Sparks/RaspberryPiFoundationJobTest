# Development History

This document outlines the iterative development process of the factory simulation project, from initial bug fixes to final refactoring and feature enhancements.

1.  **Initial Bug Squashing**: The initial phase focused on fixing a series of `TypeError` and `AttributeError` exceptions. This involved correcting how the `ConveyorBelt` object was being accessed in the strategies and aligning the method signatures in the unit tests to match the updated code.

2.  **Fixing Core Simulation Logic**: After the initial errors were resolved, a critical logic bug was discovered where the simulation would run without producing any finished products. The investigation revealed that the simulation's main loop was not advancing the workers' assembly timers correctly. The order of operations in the `run_step` method was adjusted to ensure the assembly process could complete successfully.

3.  **Improving Reporting and Debugging**: To make the simulation easier to understand and debug, several enhancements were made:
    *   The final report was corrected to accurately count the total number of products created throughout the entire simulation, rather than just a snapshot at the end.
    *   Logging was added to the strategies to announce when a worker picked up a component or placed a finished product, providing a clear, human-readable trace of the key events.

4.  **Enhancing the Visual Display**: The command-line output was significantly improved to provide a better user experience:
    *   A detailed, multi-line pictorial representation of the factory floor was created, showing the state of each worker (hands, assembly timer) and their position relative to the conveyor belt.
    *   Whitespace and formatting were adjusted to make the visual layout clean and easy to read.

5.  **Refactoring for Maintainability**: The final phase focused on improving the project's structure and code quality:
    *   **Logging Framework**: All `print()` statements were replaced with Python's standard `logging` module. This introduced structured logging with different severity levels (e.g., INFO, ERROR) and made the output consistent and filterable.
    *   **Separation of Concerns**: The presentation logic was separated from the simulation logic. A new `views.py` module was created to handle all the formatting of the visual output, making the core `simulation.py` module cleaner and more focused on its primary responsibility.

6.  **Final Bug Fixes and Feature Polish**: The last step involved fixing a failing unit test related to worker placement validation and correcting a critical flaw in the `TeamStrategy`'s scoring system that was preventing it from producing any products. The action scores were adjusted to ensure workers prioritized completing their own assemblies.
